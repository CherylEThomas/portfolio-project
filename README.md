### Design

#### Colour Scheme

* The squad colours are black, maroon and gold.  The site uses these colours along with an off-white tone to prevent the site appearing too dark.

#### Typography

* The -------- font is the main font for the site.  Sans Serif is also used in case the main font cannot be used for any reason. ------- is a simple, clear font which is easily read.

#### Imagery

* The large background hero image is the gymnastics club logo.  This clearly identifies the site and the club which the squad is part of.  
* Images on the gallery page are partly of my daughter who is a member of the squad and partly stock gymnast images as I do not have permission to include images of the other children in the squad yet.

    - The main points are made immediately with the hero image
    - The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

* As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

    - At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
    - On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    - The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
