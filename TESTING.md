### WAVE Testing

WAVE testing was carried out on every page of the project.

* All errors found on pages were resolved.
* Remaining issues are with contrast of the social media icons on the footer, however Coolors confirms the contract to be acceptable and so this element was left unresolved.
* Remaining alerts are in regards the navbar links with both the brand logo and home logo both linking to the same page.  However this is part of the page design and so was left unresolved.

 - Timetable page results ![Timetable](assets/testing-images/wave-timetable.png)

### Lighthouse Testing

Lighthouse testing was carried out on every page of the project.

* Where time allowed issues found on pages were resolved.
* Remaining issues in regards Best Practices on all pages were that the footer social media icons were considered too small.  On inspection though it seems as though the testing did not take account of the space around the icons and I felt that the icon size was acceptable.  No persons who tested the site on mobile devices for me had any issues pressing the social media icons.
* Remaining issue in regards Performance on the gallery page were that the images used need to be of a different type, resolution and size.  However time restraints prevent me from being able to update and revise the gallery images prior to the project deadline.
